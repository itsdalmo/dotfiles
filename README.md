# dotfiles

My setup for development on OS X.

## Installation

Run the installer:
```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsdalmo/dotfiles/master/install.sh)"
```

After rebooting do the following:
- Load `iterm2` preferencees from the repository.
- Install `cinch` and `1password` from the App store. 
- Set up VS Code from the settings gist.
